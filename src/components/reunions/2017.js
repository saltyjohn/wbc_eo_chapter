      <h4>Reunion Recap: </h4>
      <p style={{ textIndent: '2em' }}>The brothers of Epsilon Omicron Theta Chi invaded the Hidden Valley mountain resort in Western PA on September 15th, 16th, and 17th. Seventy brothers, wives, and friends of Chi, including several "first timers" attended our 2017 RIB party reunion weekend. Everyone enjoyed the fellowship and beer while reliving the many great memories of of the last 45 to 50 years.</p>
      <p>First timers included Frank Reitz and Bob Long both from the Class of 1972, as well as, Dave Rogers from the Class of 1967. In addition, there were several from the early and mid 1970"s- David Suriani, Charlie Pucinini, Joe Gerst, Rick Latin, Doug Doerr, Glenn Marsnick, Jeff, Andrews, Mary Jo Thompson and Cindy Simons to name a few. Rick Hunnell from Waynesburg also joined us for Saturday afternoon and evening.</p>
      <p>Friday afternoon , in "true Chi tradition" the brothers tapped a half keg out at the "fire pit" for happy hour and plenty of laughs. A group, including Brain, Locker, Mike Hastings, Hulk, Benute, Ray & Sandy Pearl, Dave Hasbrouck, and Barry & Sally Everson went to dinner at Helen's at Seven Springs. Another group of about 25 brothers went to The Laurel Mountain Inn for dinner. Afterwards, the brothers took over the "fire pit" for an evening of partying with plenty of beer.</p>
      <p>Saturday morning several brothers visited nearby attractions including the 9/11 Shanksville Memorial, "Falling Waters", Seven Springs, and Waynesburg College. Brothers Locker, Mike Hastings, and Dave Hasbrouck ran/walked in the "Wine Run" at the nearby Glades Pike Winery. In addition, Jim DeGrazia, Scott Weaver, Pete Nangeroni, and Hulk played a round of golf at a nearby golf club.</p>

      <p>More brothers arrived for the big event on Saturday afternoon with a 5 hour RIB Party. This event was held at the pavilion overlooking Hidden Valley's beautiful golf course. A moment of silence was held for Ted Ankeney, Ron Chopyak, Guy Leonard, and family members lost over the last year. A toast was made for Brother Squirrel who was unable to attend our reunion. Brain presented to all the brothers a sketch of the Wall next to Walton Hall. The RIB Party picnic included ribs, baked chicken, roasted potatoes, salad, several deserts, and unlimited beer and wine. The group then re-convened after dinner at the "fire pit" for more camaraderie and story telling.</p>
      <p>The fire pit was a huge success and very popular with the brothers.</p>
      <p>Our next reunion will be in Somers Point, NJ in 2019 and the Alumni Committee will begin plans in early 2018.</p>
