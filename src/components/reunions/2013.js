      <h4>"RIBS" Reunion Recap: </h4>
      <p style={{ textIndent: '2em' }}>The brothers of Epsilon Omicron Theta Chi invaded Waynesburg June 28, 29, and 30th and the Burg is still trying to recover!  100 brothers, spouses, and friends of Chi, including 9 "first timers", enjoyed the RIBS, beer, and fellowship reliving the many great memories and laughs of the past 40+ years making this the LARGEST reunion ever. The reunion classes ranged from 1964 to 1979.</p>
      <p>"First Timers" included: Ted Ankeney, "The Incredible Hulk" John Mamula, Ellis Weitzman, "Jeep" Anderson, Mike Novak, Don Thomas, Todd Latshaw, Ian Dahlgard, and Tom Higgins. In addition, Joe Denti, an old TKE friend, Babe Bennett '66, an old Delt friend, and Dave Rohanna, an old Phi Sig friend were in attendance. Some local friends from Waynesburg: JB, Rick Hunnell, Hobbs, "Chap",  and another old Phi Sig buddy, Gary Klinefelter,  also joined us Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Many thanks to "Chap" and Gary Klinefelter for all their help with local planning.</p>
      <p>Brothers brought back yearbooks, photo albums, and composites from the early 1960's and 1970's. Everyone enjoyed going thru the memorabilia and pictures and reminiscing about the "good old days of OX". Several brothers drove to 495 Huffman Street.</p>
      <p>In true "Chi tradition" the brothers had a Friday afternoon keg party in Lions Community Park with about 50 people. The group later moved over to Tommy Boy's, which was once The Triangle, for dinner.</p>
      <p>Saturday morning brothers were treated to a welcome reception and luncheon by the new incoming President of Waynesburg University, Doug Lee. This was followed by a lengthy tour of the campus by Doug Lee and Courtney Dennis, Assistant Director of Alumni Relations. The University has added new buildings and an off campus sports facility since our last gathering in 2009.</p>
      <p>More brothers arrived for the big event on Saturday afternoon with an 8 hour Rib Party with plenty of beer and wine. Doug Lee stopped by for a "meet and greet".Class pictures were taken from 1964 to 1979. Pete Nangeroni took a group picture which will be posted on the OX web-site. Art "Plug" Swartwout told some of the brothers some funny stories about his living in the Denver area while Brother "Bear" was also living there; also some stories about Brother "Beaver".</p>
      <p>Art Swartwout contacted more brothers from 1960 to 1966 who returned to this reunion. I urged Jim Fedorka and Jay Stockman to do the same and bring more brothers from the mid 1970's to keep our reunion family growing.</p>
      <p>Our next reunion will be in Somers Point, NJ in June 2015 and the Alumni Committee will begin plans in early 2014.</p>
